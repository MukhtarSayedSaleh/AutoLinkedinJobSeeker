# Introduction
At the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic, I have been laid off like thousands of colleagues as we were serving an Airline-industry company. Shortly after that, I found myself applying to jobs again and again and again with a kind of static pattern & because I'm a bit lazy, I wrote this simple Python script to automate the application process as I was super busy learning PS5 FIFA tricks & practicing them during the looooong lockdown.
